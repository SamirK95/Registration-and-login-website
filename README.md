# Registration-and-login-website
This is registration and login website.
I made this website using ASP.NET, CSS, C# and MSSQL.
If you want to clone this project to the visual studio, you need to update DOM.
After cloning project to the folder, open it with visual studio and in the solution explorer 
right click on the solution and go to Manage NuGet Packages and click tab-update, 
select the whole project and click update. After that it's updated, and you can use this project.
